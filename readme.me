# 🌍 Personal Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal repository — a curated collection of my projects exploring the power of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science across multiple domains, including:

- 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- 🤖 Machine Learning (ML)  
- 👁️ Computer Vision  
- 💹 Finance  
- 🌦️ Climate Change  

Each project reflects my interest in leveraging cutting-edge technologies and data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems.

## 🔍 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

```

/nlp
/machine-learning
/computer-vision
/finance
/climate-change

```

Each folder contains one or more self-contained projects with the following structure (may vary slightly):

```

project-name/
│
├── data/            # Sample datasets or data preprocessing scripts
├── notebooks/       # Jupyter notebooks with analysis or model development
├── src/             # Core code and model implementation
├── results/         # Outputs, visualizations, and evaluation results
└── README.md        # Project-specific documentation
