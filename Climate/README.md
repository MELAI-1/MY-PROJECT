Climate Science Projects Repository
This repository contains all my projects related to climate science, developed as part of my academic and research journey. As a Master's student at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) in Cape Town, South Africa, I focus on leveraging artificial intelligence and data science to address climate-related challenges, particularly in the African context.

Projects Overview

Federated Learning for Respiratory Disease Forecasting in Africa: A project exploring federated learning techniques to predict respiratory diseases influenced by climate factors, recognized with the Best Poster Award at Deep Learning Indaba 2025.
IWMI CGIAR Climate Action Internship: Contributions to climate resilience and water management research, starting January 2026.
[Add other projects as they develop, e.g., climate modeling or AI applications.]

Purpose
This repository serves as a central hub to document, share, and collaborate on my climate science initiatives, reflecting my commitment to sustainable solutions using AI.
