## Background

This repository gathers a wide range of AI projects developed to address real-world problems through data-centric approaches and modern machine learning techniques. The projects span five major domains: **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Computer Vision (CV)**, **Finance**, and **Climate Change**. The objective is to demonstrate practical solutions, predictive modeling, and intelligent systems using real-world datasets and state-of-the-art algorithms.



## Domains & Projects

### 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Transformer-based models (BERT, GPT) for multilingual tasks

### 🤖 Machine Learning
- Supervised/unsupervised pipelines
- Model evaluation & interpretability
- Feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning
- Feature selection

### 👁️ Computer Vision
- Object detection (YOLOv5, SSD)
- Image classification with CNNs
- Image segmentation and real-time inference

### 💹 Finance
- Credit risk modeling: PD, LGD, EAD, EL
- Time series analysis and stock prediction
- Portfolio optimization and financial dashboards

### 🌍 Climate Change
- Rainfall prediction from satellite data
- Air quality forecasting and anomaly detection
- Spatiotemporal analysis of climate variables


## Pipeline Examples

Here’s a typical pipeline structure used across projects:

## Key Notebooks

Each domain contains Jupyter Notebooks illustrating:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training, validation, and tuning
- Visualizations and interpretability
- Evaluation metrics and reporting


## Datasets

Projects use open-source datasets from platforms such as:
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu)
- [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/) (climate)
- [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/) (finance)
- Custom datasets collected or simulated for specific use-cases


## Technologies
